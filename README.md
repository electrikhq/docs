# Hello Electrik

## What is Electrik?

Electrik is an open-source Laravel starter kit for your next big SaaS. It's 100% open source and you can use it for commercial purposes

## Why another Laravel starter kit?

It's true that there are some fantastic starter kits available out there. Some of them are offically supported by Laravel itself.&#x20;

My primary reason behind creating this starter kit is to provide all the essential nuts and bolts required to create a base for a solid SaaS application. Also, I am an avid fan of open source. And it hurts me to see that almost all other starter kits have some or the other features locked as premium features and they ask for paid subscriptions.

This is why I have built Electrik. It has everything that you need to start your next SaaS project, right from user management to subscription billing! And I plan to keep it open source. I am also planning to make it a sponsor-ware, where you are not bound by subscription plans or one-time payments. If you want to sponsor this project, you are most welcome. If not, you are still most welcome :smile:

## What features does Electrik provide?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of features you get out of the box:

* User management
* Team management
* Subscription Billing via Stripe
* Notifications alerts
* Banners
* Roles and Permissions Management
* and much more
