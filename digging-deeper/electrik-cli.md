# Electrik CLI

Electrik comes with two commands:

`php artisan electrik:install`

`php artisan electrik:make`

Both register themselves automatically with Laravel

### Install command

Install command is the essence of Electrik. It installs all the necessary packages, migrations, notifications, etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
Goes without saying, that please install Ellectrik only on a fresh Laravell application.
{% endhint %}

### Make command

`electrik:make` command is used to publish a new controller and view. It publishes a Livewire component with some enhancements provided by Electrik.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have plans to introduce more features to make commands in upcoming versions.
{% endhint %}
